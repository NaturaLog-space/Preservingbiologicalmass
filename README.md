# Method of Speed Freeze Drying While Maintaining Flavor Through Reconstitution and Long Term Storage of Flavor and Aroma 9/5/23

Freeze Dried Fruit tastes a bit bland. Where did the flavor go? This method stores the flavor lost through sublimation. The essence of strawberrry is in its dried long shelf life form and aroma water which also has a long shelf life.
 
- Increasing the shelf temperature to 30-60C to Increase the amount of water sublimated.
- Capturing the fraction of Distillate in the Cold Trap for Reconstitution.
    - The fraction of distillate in the cold trap contains water and aroma compounds which are lost in the freeze drying process.
    - Collecting the initial distillate of aroma for reconstitution.
      - Initial Distillate fractions from the first distillate to midway of the distillation process.
    - Storing the aroma distillate for reconstitution.

# Creating Delicious Incentives to Eat Global Warming 8/22/23
The problem with methods of carbon capture is that there needs to be incentives or subsidies to make carbon capture viable. To make carbon capture viable, the system needs to be self sustaining without the need of incentives or subsidies in order to be natural.

## Creating a Delicious Product
- Fruit jams that are delicious.

## Selecting a Method of Carbon Capture
- Mulberries are known to absorb lots of carbon from the atmosphere.
- https://www.single.earth/blog/which-trees-absorb-the-most-carbon

## Creating Carbon Negative Revenue
- Mulberries are delicious and have medicinal properties
- Lumber from mulberries are high quality hardwood

## Selling Carbon Credits
- Offset the carbon dioxide from oil industries while we transition to clean energy
- Sell carbon credits
- Oil companies invest in mulberry plantations.
- Selling carbon farms like solar farms


# Preserving Biological Mass as a Food Source
The purpose of this document and project is to preserve fruits/plant matter in orderr to elongate the freshness for space travel and for basic consumption. The project stands for the elevation of the everyday food with the public interest in mind. I believe humanity will enjoy the flavor and nutrition of a novel vegan preserve. It is in public interest to bring forth the industrialization of high quality affordable preserves for all social classes and citizens. 

![Logo](/Logo2.png)

We ask how can we preserve something for a long time without the thermal degradation of traditional jam making methodology. The procedure brings fruit/plant matter to a low activity of microbial life to enable the long term preservation of fruit/plant matter. In order to achieve preservation, the final substance needs to approach a low level of hydration. Reduction of water activity level by 0.5 - 0.8 would create an environment where microbial activity is reduced or stunted. Methods such as sublimating the water in fruit/plant matter, addition of food grade sweetening agents, and acidifying using organic acids, decrease the microbial activity level.

The preserve after having the water acivity reduced by 0.5-0.8 would be at a water activity level of 0.2-0.5
An ideal water activity level would be 0.2 for the preserve.

## Drying Fruits
How to freeze dry fruits while preserving the aromatics of the fruit:
- Set the vacuum to 3-4.5 torr of pressure
- Set the Temperature range to -50C to 0C
- https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Changes-of-temperature-and-pressure-during-freeze-drying-process-24-Handing-and_fig2_335669275


## Fruit Preserves
Creating a fruit preserve allows the final product to:
- Have elongated shelf life of regular fruit
- Preserve the aromatics of the fruit
- Have Brix content range from 40-80
- Have a pH level of <3.1
- https://bio.libretexts.org/Courses/Manchester_Community_College_%28MCC%29/Remix_of_Openstax%3AMicrobiology_by_Parker_Schneegurt_et_al/08%3A_Microbial_Growth/8.03%3A_The_Effects_of_pH_on_Microbial_Growth
![pH](/PhMicrobe.jpg)

### Example
- In a sample batch of 1381 grams of strawberries we aim to achieve a range of 320-350 gram of strawberry post sublimation.
- The brix level of the mixture is brought to 70 through the addition of sweetening agents such as sucrose.
- To the fruit/strawberry/plant matter mixture, sucrose/sweetener is added to bring the mixture to a brix reading of 70.
- Take a pH reading of the product as each batch will have a different pH reading.
- https://www.chem.purdue.edu/gchelp/howtosolveit/Equilibrium/Calculating_pHandpOH.htm#:~:text=Calculating_pHandpOH&text=To%20calculate%20the%20pH%20of,%5BH3O%2B%5D
- To adjust the final pH, x grams of Citric acid is added to obtain a pH reading of 3.0.
- To ensure longevity of preservation and consumer safety, the final product must have a pH reading of <3.1

## Fruit Preserves
- Brix content of the final fruit and sugar mixture is ranges from 40-80 brix.
- The fruit sugar mixture is pH adjusted using food grade edible acids.
- Increasing fruit content of the final product is adjusted by adding in freeze dried fruit/plant matter.

## Disclosure of Food Safety
- The experimental preserve is not deemed food safe as it is a raw product that is preserved.
- Pathogens, botulin spores, mold spores contamination from the farm.
- Having too low of a pH also causes cavities as it becomes more acidic than lemons.
- Citric acid metabolism from microbes may raise pH to dangerous levels.
- Enjoy the preserve the day it is made. Storing the preserve increases the risk of mold and food poisoning.
- "Food Contamination: Aspergillus restrictus has been associated with food spoilage and can contaminate a variety of food products, especially those exposed to salt, such as cured meats, salted fish, and salted snacks." -ChatGPT

## Method of Washing and Sanitizing
- Place fruit in a ultrasonic cleaner with ozone and soap solution where the fruit is only 1 layer of fruit with no impediment to the line of sight from the ultrasonic transducer.
- Sonicate the fruit for 5 minute while constantly moving the fruit around for proper cleaning of all cavities.
- Isolate the fruit from the cleaner using a strainer or basket.
- Rinse fruit with ozone water.

## Method of Processing for the OCD
- In a clean room sanitized with UV and fumigated with ozone, the processing of fruit takes place. Removal and deactivation of fungal / microbial spores is crucial for food safety.
- If using a hood then the hood needs to be sanitized and fumigated with ozone. 
- All ingredients entering the clean room either gets thermally sterilized at 150C for 1 hour or goes through an ultrasonic ozone + soap wash.
- All equipments are autoclaved for 1 hour prior to use.
- All employees are to wear clean suits, gloves, and require respirators to filter any foreign particulates from respiration.
- https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK310477/
- https://blog.gotopac.com/2018/02/14/cleanroom-preparation-procedure/


## Method of Freeze Drying for the OCD
- A water cooled freeze drier is used to reduce the amount of airflow in the clean room.
- Freeze drier is sanitized using ozone fumigation and uv light. The inside of the freeze drier should be cleaned with soap and ozone water with every use.
- If the fruit is moved from a hood into the freeze drier, then the fruit needs to be moved from sanitary containment from the hood to the freeze drier.
- Containment vessel should be washed with ozone water anytime it moves through air.

## Measurement of Water Activity
- The process of measuring water activity level per batch would be a food safety issue. The method of measuring water activity level would be to creating a cold plate and observing the reflectivity index of the cold plate in the atmosphere of the preserve measured alongside a reference index of reflectivity. 

## Method of Blending and Sonication
- Direct drying of fruit/plant matter to the specified water activity level of the mixture or blending freeze dried fruit/plant matter to fresh fruit/plant matter to lower the water activity level.
- Blending the fruit/plant matter with sweeteners, organic acids, freeze dried fruit/plant matter.
- Sonication of preserve to create a metastable product at 20khz - 120khz with sonic power density of 10w/l - 40w/l for 30 minutes - 4 hour depending on the frequency and wattage density. 40w/l has best performance.
- Keeping the mixture at a temperature between -10C to 40C for a raw processed product. The lower the temperature the better.
- Keeping the atmospheric pressure for the mixture between .5 atm to 2 atm to decrease the amount of natural volatiles from vaporizing. The higher the pressure the better.
- https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/elsc.200390018  Sonication for metastable product.

- https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34868698/
- Natamycin inhibits mold and fungal growth
- 
## Nutrition Disclosure
- Ozone washing oxidizes vitamins and antioxidants hence there is a loss of nutrients.
- Standard method of calculating the vitamins and nutrients in the jam is insufficient due to the oxidation.
- Every batch should be lab tested for the vitamin content and be supplemented the amount of oxidized vitamins and antioxidants.

## Extrusion into Jars
- Every company has their own method and setup.
