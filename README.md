# Preserving Biological Mass as a Food Source
The purpose of this document and project is to preserve biological mass to elongate the freshness of food.

We ask how can we preserve something for a long time without thermal degradation. The procedure is bringing biological mass to a low activity of microbial life to enable the long term preservation of biological mass from the threats of detravores.

In order to achieve preservation, the final substance needs to approach a low level of hydration by the addition of substances such as long chained organic energy.

## Drying Fruits
How to dry fruits while preserving the aromatics of the fruit:
- Set the vacuum to 3-4.5 torr of pressure
- Set the Temperature range to -50C to 0C 

## Strawberry Preserves
Creating a strawberry preserve allows the final product to:
- Have elongated shelf life of regular strawberries
- Preserve the aromatics of the strawberry
- Have Brix content above 60
- Have a pH level of <3.1

### Example
- In a sample batch of 1381 grams of strawberries we aim to achieve a range of 320-350 gram of strawberry after the sublimination process.
- The brix level of the mixture is brought to 70 through the addition of sweetening agents such as sucrose.
- To ensure longevity of preservation and consumer safety, the final product should have a pH reading of <3.1
- 

## Fruit Preserves
- Brix content of the final fruit and sugar mixture is best set to 70.
- The fruit sugar mixture is pH adjusted using food grade edible acids.
- Increasing fruit content of the final product is adjusted by adding in dry fruit mass.
