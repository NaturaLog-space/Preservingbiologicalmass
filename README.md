# Preserving Biological Mass as a Food Source
The purpose of this document and project is to preserve biological mass to elongate the freshness of food. It is in the public interest to raise the standard of everyday food. I believe humans prefer to enjoy what they eat. Let's transform traditional preserves into flavor packed, nutritionally dense, preserves. It is in our interest to bring forth the industrialization of high quality food for all social classes and citizens. 

We ask how can we preserve something for a long time without thermal degradation. The procedure is bringing biological mass to a low activity of microbial life to enable the long term preservation of biological mass. In order to achieve preservation, the final substance needs to approach a low level of hydration. Reduction of water activity level ranging from 0.6-0.7 would create an environment where microbial activity is reduced or stunted. Methods such as sublimation of water, addition of food grade sweetening agents, and pH adjustments using organic acids.


## Drying Fruits
How to dry fruits while preserving the aromatics of the fruit:
- Set the vacuum to 3-4.5 torr of pressure
- Set the Temperature range to -50C to 0C 

## Fruit Preserves
Creating a fruit preserve allows the final product to:
- Have elongated shelf life of regular fruit
- Preserve the aromatics of the fruit
- Have Brix content above 60
- Have a pH level of <3.1

### Example
- In a sample batch of 1381 grams of strawberries we aim to achieve a range of 320-350 gram of strawberry post sublimation.
- The brix level of the mixture is brought to 70 through the addition of sweetening agents such as sucrose.
- To the post sublimated Fragaria fruit mixture, x grams of sucrose is added to bring the mixture to a brix reading of 70.
- Take a pH reading of the product as each batch will have a different pH reading.

- To adjust the final pH, x grams of Citric acid is added to obtain a pH reading of 3.0.
- To ensure longevity of preservation and consumer safety, the final product must have a pH reading of <3.1

## Fruit Preserves
- Brix content of the final fruit and sugar mixture is best set to 70.
- The fruit sugar mixture is pH adjusted using food grade edible acids.
- Increasing fruit content of the final product is adjusted by adding in dry fruit mass.

## Disclosure of Food Safety
- The experimental preserve is not deemed food safe as it is a raw product that is preserved.
- Pathogens and spores existing in air or on the plant are present.
