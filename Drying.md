# Drying Fruits
- There are infinite methods of freeze drying fruits.


## Solar Drying Fruits

- Slice plant/fruit matter into thickness of .1 to 1 cm
- Place fruits on a sun drying basket or tray.
- Weigh the fruit on a scale
- Place the plant/fruit matter into the sun
- Weigh the fruit on a scale
- Dehydrate until the final weight is 15-20% of its starting weight

## Oven Drying

- Slice plant/fruit matter into thickness of .1 to 1 cm
- Place fruits on a baking tray with a silicone liner
- Weigh the fruit on a scale
- Set the temperature to between 40-60 Celcius
- Place the plant/fruit matter into an oven
- Dehydrate until the plant/fruit matter is 15-20% of its starting weight

## Vacuum Drying

- Slice plant/fruit matter into thickness of .1 to 1 cm
- Place fruits on a tray lined with silicone
- Weigh the fruit on a scale
- Place the plant/fruit matter into the vacuum chamber
- Utilize a cold trap
- Set temperature 20C below the condensation temperature for the cold trap
- Pull vacuum to desired vacuum according the temperature of the dehydration.
- Room temperature vacuum drying would be 20C
- Clear cold trap as the cold trap becomes filled with condensation
- Weigh the fruit on a scale
- Dehydrate until the final weight is 10-15% of its starting weight

## Freeze Drying

- Slice plant/fruit matter into thickness of .1 to 1 cm
- Place fruits on a tray lined with silicone
- Weigh the fruit on a scale
- Place fruits into the freeze drier
- Set the vacuum to 3-4.5 torr of pressure
- Set the Temperature range to -50C to 0C

- Clear cold trap as the cold trap becomes filled with condensation
- Weigh the fruit on a scale
- Dehydrate until the final weight is 10-15% of its starting weight

## Supercritical Drying

- Slice plant/fruit matter into thickness of .1 to 1 cm
- Place fruits on a tray lined with silicone
- Weigh the fruit on a scale
- Place fruits into a high pressure chamber
- Fill the high pressure chamber with Liquid CO2 and food grade ethanol
- Heat the chamber with CO2 to the critical point in accordance to the pressure of the vessel
- Release pressure inside the vessel to quickly evaporate the solvent from the fruit.
- Weigh the fruit on a scale
- Dehydrate until the final weight is 10-15% of its starting weight

## Thin Film Vacuum Drying

- Puree fruit/plant matter until its fluid and no longer a solid
- Weigh the puree
- Place the puree in a rotovap
- Run the rotovap until the puree is 20-40% of its final weight

## Space Drying

- Build a rocket
- Send Fruit/plant matter to space, or grow fruit/plant matter in space
- Slice or puree the fruit or utilize whole fruit
- Weigh the fruit/plant matter
- Along cold plates expose the fruit/plant matter to  the vacuum of space
- Weigh the fruit/plant matter
- Dehydrate the fruit/plant matter until it is 10-15% of its starting weight
