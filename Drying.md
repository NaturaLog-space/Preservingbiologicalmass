# Drying Fruits
- There are infinite methods of freeze drying fruits.


## Solar Drying Fruits
- Slice plant/fruit matter into thickness of .1 to 1 cm
- Place fruits on a sun drying basket or tray.
- Weigh the fruit on a scale
- Place the plant/fruit matter into the sun
- Weigh the fruit on a scale
- Dehydrate until the final weight is 15-20% of its starting weight

## Oven Drying
- Slice plant/fruit matter into thickness of .1 to 1 cm
- Place fruits on a baking tray with a silicone liner
- Weigh the fruit on a scale
- Set the temperature to between 40-60 Celcius
- Place the plant/fruit matter into an oven
- Dehydrate until the plant/fruit matter is 15-20% of its starting weight

## Vacuum Drying
- Slice plant/fruit matter into thickness of .1 to 1 cm
- Place fruits on a tray lined with silicone
- Weigh the fruit on a scale
- Place the plant/fruit matter into the vacuum chamber
- Utilize a cold trap
- Set temperature 20C below the condensation temperature for the cold trap
- Pull vacuum to desired vacuum according the temperature of the dehydration.
- Room temperature vacuum drying would be 20C
- Clear cold trap as the cold trap becomes filled with condensation
- Weigh the fruit on a scale
- Dehydrate until the final weight is 10-15% of its starting weight

## Freeze Drying
- Slice plant/fruit matter into thickness of .1 to 1 cm
- Place fruits on a tray lined with silicone
- Weigh the fruit on a scale
- Set the vacuum to 3-4.5 torr of pressure
- Set the Temperature range to -50C to 0C

- Weigh the fruit on a scale
- Dehydrate until the final weight is 10-15% of its starting weight
